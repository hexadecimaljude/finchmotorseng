# FINCH MOTORS ENGINEERING (FME) üë®‚Äçüîß

Finch Motors Engineering is the business name of a reliable mobile mechanic, currently operating without a functional website. The URL below, which is supposed to hold the main website, instead shows the user a page showing that the website is in progress. Thanks to the miraculous appearance of motivation and free time, I now have the ability to work on this website, with the intention of launching it for the public to see as soon as possible.

The absence of a functional website cannot be the case forever.

The existence of a functioning website allows potential customers to see what services are available with FME, and can allow them to safely determine whether or not this is the correct one to choose in terms of pricing and desperation for the completion of a job. (Not to be biased, but FME _is_ fantastic)

Considering how intrigued I am to get this website working as soon as possible, this repository has been created to allow amendments to the same website from different devices, whether that's from a different PC, or even a virtual machine.

Wish me luck. Enjoy these changes.

_Is anyone actually going to have read this?_
